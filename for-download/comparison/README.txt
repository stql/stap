* All the needed data are from UCSC, as they are large and easily downloaded from the Internet, we don't provide them here.  
* If the users want to run the experiments, they need to prepare the data first and modify the relative file and directory path in testall.py or testbedtools.py.
* testall.py is the python script which implemented all the example queries, testbedtools.py is also a python script, but it is just a wrapper which invokes bedtools to do the core job to finish some example queries, the reason to use python script to control bedtools is to make the whole experiment easier such as time recording, file managing, but the core functions are exactly finished by bedtools.
